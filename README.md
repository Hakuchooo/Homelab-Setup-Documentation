# 🖥️ Homelab Setup & Upgrade Documentation

This repository documents my homelab journey — from initial setup to upgrades, configuration changes, and experimental projects.  
It serves as both a personal log and a reference for others interested in building their own homelab.

## Overview
> My homelab is a small-scale home server environment used for self-hosting services, learning networking concepts, experimenting with Linux, and running development projects.

---

## Current Setup 
| Device | Model / Specs | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Main Router | [PLDT/Converge ISP router] | Internet access from ISP |
| Ethernet Switch | [Mercusys/8 slots] | Connect multiple devices via LAN |
| PC1 | Forgot/8gb ddr4 /500gb HDD / 120gb SSD| Main daily driver / server experiments and monitoring |
| PC2 | Core i5 2ND GEN/8gb ddr3 /500gb HDD(low) | NAS server |

---

## Software 

| Device | OS / Software | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| PC1 | EndeavourOS | Main OS for monitoring |
| PC2 | Open Media Vault | NAS / Storage |

## Notes
- **PC 1:** Runs **EndeavourOS** (Arch-based Linux).  
- **PC 2:** Runs **OpenMediaVault** (Debian-based NAS OS).  
- Current setup is simple — no dedicated firewall appliance or virtualization yet.  
- Upgrade path:  
  1. Add Archer router for basic network isolation.  
  2. Replace Archer with an **OPNsense** router running on dedicated hardware for advanced routing and security.
